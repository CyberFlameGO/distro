*implements* Foswiki::Iterator

Combine multiple iterators into a single iteration.

---++ new(iterators => \@list, uniqueOnly => $unique)

Create a new iterator over the given list of iterators. The list is
not damaged in any way.

If =uniqueOnly= is true, we try to not repeat values.
Warning: =uniqueOnly= assumes that the values are strings.

Returns false when the iterator is exhausted.

=begin TML

---++ next() -> $data

Return the next entry in the list.

The iterator object can be customised to pre- and post-process entries from
the list before returning them. This is done by setting two fields in the
iterator object:

   * ={filter}= can be defined to be a sub that filters each entry. The entry
     will be ignored (next() will not return it) if the filter returns false.
   * ={process}= can be defined to be a sub to process each entry before it
     is returned by next. The value returned from next is the value returned
     by the process function.

=cut

sub next {
    my $this = shift;
    $this->hasNext();
    my $n = $this->_next;
    $this->_clear_next;
    $n = &{ $this->process }($n) if $this->process;

    #print STDERR "next - $n \n";
    return $n;
}

    my $this = shift;
}
