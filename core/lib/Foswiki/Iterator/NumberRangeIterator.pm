=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::Iterator::NumberRangeIterator

Iterator over a range of integer values, with programmable increment.

=begin TML

---++ ClassMethod new(start => $start, end => $end, inc => $inc)
Construct a new iterator from start to end step inc.
The range is inclusive i.e. if $end == $start, you will get an iterator
that returns a single value.

The iteration step is the absolute value of $inc, and defaults to 1.

has end   => ( is => 'rw', required => 1, );
has inc   => ( is => 'rw', default  => 1, );
has cur =>
  ( is => 'rw', lazy => 1, clearer => 1, default => sub { $_[0]->start }, );

    my $this = shift;
    $this->inc(
        $this->end > $this->start ? abs( $this->inc ) : -abs( $this->inc ) );
