---+ Class Foswiki::Config::Node

A class defining config spec node.

---++ SYNOPSIS

<verbatim>
my $value = $node->getValue;
</verbatim>

---++ DESCRIPTION

Nodes can be of two types: a branch or a leaf. A branch is a node which has or
may have subnodes. A leaf is a node storing a configuration value. Both types of
nodes can have properties defined by object attributes.

A Node can be either in uninitialized or initialized state when it has a value
assigned. The value could be anything â€“ including *undef*. The difference between
modes is defined by =$node-&gt;has_value=. If there is no value then it's defined
by =default= attribute.

=begin TML

---+++ ObjectAttribute value

Node's assigned value.

=cut

# Value could be anything.

    is        => 'rw',

---+++ ObjectAttribute default

Node's default value as defined by spec.

=cut

has default => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => 1,

---+++ ObjectAttribute parent

Parent container object of class =Foswiki::Config::DataHash=.

---+++ ObjectAttribute section

Config section this node belongs to.

=begin TML

---+++ ObjectAttribute isLeaf => bool

Defines if this is a leaf node, or branch, or type of this node is undefined yet
(if attribute's value is undef). 

=cut

has isLeaf => ( is => 'rw', );

stubMethods qw(prepareParent prepareSection prepareValue);

=begin TML

---+++ ObjectMethod isBranch => bool

Returns true if node is a branch.

=cut

sub isBranch {
    my $this = shift;
    return defined $this->isLeaf && !$this->isLeaf;
}

=begin TML

---+++ ObjectMethod isVague => bool

Returns true if node type is yet undetermined.

=cut

sub isVague {
    my $this = shift;
    return !defined $this->isLeaf;
}

=begin TML

---+++ ObjectMethod getValue

A wrapper for =value= and =default= attributes. Returns either =value= if
assigned or =default= otherwise.

=cut

sub getValue {
    my $this = shift;

    return $this->has_value
      ? $this->value
      : ( $this->has_default ? $this->default : undef );

=begin TML

---+++ ObjectMethod _trigger_value

Trigger method of =value= attribute.
