=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::Iterator

This class cannot be instantiated on its own - it is an interface
specification for iterators. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_Pattern
for more information on the iterator pattern.

The interface only supports forward iteration. Subclasses should use this
as their base class (so that =$it->isa("Foswiki::Iterator")= returns true),
and must implement =hasNext= and =next= per the specification below.

See Foswiki::ListIterator for an example implementation.

    assert    => Maybe [ArrayRef],

requires qw(hasNext next reset);

=begin TML

---++ hasNext() -> $boolean

Returns true if the iterator has more items, or false when the iterator
is exhausted.

=cut

=begin TML

---++ reset() -> $boolean

resets the iterator to the begining - returns false if it can't

=cut

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod all() -> @list

Exhaust the iterator. Return all remaining elements in the iteration
as a list. The returned list should be considered to be immutable.

The default implementation simply runs the iterator to its end.

=cut

sub all {
    my ($this) = @_;
    my @remains;
    while ( $this->hasNext() ) {
        push( @remains, $this->next() );
    }
    return @remains;
}
