---+ Class Foswiki::Object

This is the base object for all Foswiki classes. It defines the default
behaviour and general policies for its descendants.

---++ Implementation details.

=Foswiki::Object= is a subclass of Moo and as such inherits all its features.

---+++ Behavior changing conditions

This class' behavior could be changed by either a environment variable
=FOSWIKI_NOSTACKTRACE= and =%PERLDOC{"Assert" text="Assert's"}%= module constant
=DEBUG=. These changes should be completely transparent for the rest of core
code and only be of any interest for debugging purposes. The =DEBUG= constant is
of main significance here. =FOSWIKI_NOSTACKTRACE= is taken into account with
=DEBUG= being _true_ only.

With =DEBUG= this class:

   * records object origins recording information about the source which created
     the object. The information includes: file, line, package, subroutine name,
     and stack trace of the point where and when the =new()= method has been
     called. The information is stored in ==__origin_*= set of object
     attributes.
   * Dumps any keys found on object's hash which are not attributes declared
     with =Moo= =has=. This is to trace down legacy use of object.
     
When =FOSWIKI_NOSTACKTRACE= environment variable is set to a _true_ value then
stack trace recording is switched off. The recording is quite lingering
procedure and object creation is something done pretty frequently. So, running
code in =DEBUG= mode might become a part of Buddhist patience training for some.

---+++ Attribute validators.

Since =Moo= doesn't provide any standard checker for an attribute =isa= option
we wrote our own basic validtation methods. Those are static methods which are
named =isaTYPE()=. Currently only three =TYPEs= are supported: *ARRAY*, *HASH*,
and *CLASS*. See respective methods documentation.

A typical use of them would look like the following code:

<verbatim class="perl">
package Foswiki::SomeClass;
...
has meta => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Foswiki::Object::isaCLASS( 'meta', 'Foswiki::Meta', noUndef => 1, ),
);
</verbatim>

See =CPAN:Moo= IMPORTED SUBROUTINES -> =has= documentation.

---+++ Object stringifiction

=Foswiki::Object= overrides the stringification operator =""=
(see CPAN:overload) and maps it onto
=%PERLDOC{"Foswiki::Object" method="to_str" text="to_str()"}%= method. The
original method preserves Perl's standard behavior but could be overridden
by inheriting classes to achieve their goals. Check the
%PERLDOC{Foswiki::Exception}% code for an example use of this method.

---++ ClassMethod classAttributes -> \@attributes

A convenience shortcat to =Foswiki::Class::getClassAttributes()=.

Returns a list of names of class attributes.

This method could be used both as class and object method:

<verbatim>

my @attrs = $obj->classAttributes;

@attrs = Foswiki::Object->classAttributes;

</verbatim>

=cut

sub classAttributes {
    my $class = shift;

    # Make both class and object method style calls possible.
    $class = ref($class) || $class;
    return Foswiki::Class::getClassAttributes($class);
}

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod clone() -> $clonedObject

This method tries to do it's best to create an exact copy of existing object.
For that purpose this method considers a object as a data structure and
traverses it recursively creating a profile for new object's constructor. All
keys on object's hash are considered as attributes to be inserted into the
profile. In other words it means that if we have an object with keys =key1=,
=key2=, and =key3= then new object's constructor will get the following profile:

<verbatim>
my @profile = (
    key1 => $this->_cloneData( $this->{key1} ),  
    key2 => $this->_cloneData( $this->{key2} ),  
    key3 => $this->_cloneData( $this->{key3} ),  
);
my $newObj = ref($this)->new( @profile );
</verbatim>

But don't take this example seriously. The real life is more complicated. It's
ruled by the following statements:

   1. If a key name begins with =__[__[...]]orig_= prefix it is used for
      debugging needs and keeps object's creation history. To preserve the full
      history which would include the original creation moment as well as all
      cloning events such keys are prepended with additional =__= (double
      underscore) prefix. So, a clone of clone would have three copies of such
      keys named =__orig_*=, =____orig_*=, and =______orig_*=.
   1. All other attributes with =__= prefixed names are ignored and not
      duplicated.
   1. If a class wants to take care of cloning of an attribute it can define a
      =_clone_<attribute_name>()= method (say, =_clone_key2()= for the above
      example; or =_clone__attr()= for a private attribute =_attr=). In this
      case the attribute value will be ignored by cloning code and the return
      from the =_clone_<attribute_name>()= method would be used instead.
   1. Any blessed reference is considered a object. If the object has =clone()=
      method then the method is used to clone the object.
   1. For objects without =clone()= method they're copied as a hash which is
      then blessed into the object's class. %BR%
      *%X% NOTE:* This won't work for non-hash blessed references. They're must
      be taken care by the class itself by defining respective
      =_clone_attribute()= method.
   1. Regexp's refs are just copied into destination.
   1. Attributes containing references of *ARRAY*, *HASH*, and *SCALAR* types
      are cloned; refs of other types are just copied into destination. If
      copying is not a desirable behavior then respective =_clone_attribute()=
      method must be present.
   1. If a reference is weakened it's clone is weakened too.
   1. If same reference found at two or more locations of cloned object's
      structure then destination object will have identical cloned references at
      same locations; i.e. if
      <verbatim>$this->attr1 &#61;&#61; $this->attr2->subattr->[3]</verbatim>
      then
      <verbatim>$cloned->attr1 &#61;&#61; $cloned->attr2->subattr->[3]</verbatim>
      too.
   1. Circular dependecies are raising =Foswiki::Exception::Fatal=.

=begin TML

---++ StaticMethod isaCLASS( $attributeName, $className, \%params )

isa validator generator checking if attribute is a class =$className= or it's
descendant.

---++++!! Parameters

| *Key* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =noUndef= | do not allow undef value | _false_ |
| =strictMatch= | allow only =$className=, no decsendants | _false_ |
| =does= | defines a role the class must do |  |

By using =does= we can define not only that the object must be, say, a
=Foswiki::Object= descendant but that it has to have =Foswiki::AppObject=
applied:

<verbatim>
has childObject => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Foswiki::Object::isaCLASS(
            'childObject',
            'Foswiki::Object',
            does => 'Foswiki::AppObject',
    ),
);
</verbatim>

Currently only a single role could be defined for =does=.
