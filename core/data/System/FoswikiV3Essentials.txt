---+ Foswiki v3 Essentials
%TOC%

This category is dedicated to development under Foswiki v3 core. 

Basically, what makes v3 different from all previous versions are:

   $ Full OO : New version is totally redesigned. Where all previous versions
   were basically procedural code using some OO elements â€“ v3 is OO from the
   first call of =%PERLDOC{"Foswiki::App" method="run"}%= method.
   $ Application centric : Everything in the new core is summoned and
   manipulated by a single application object.
   $ Engines reconsidered : Engine role in the core ecosystem has been slightly
   revised.
   $ PSGI support : Yes, the new code is PSGI compliant. Basically, it is the
   main and only mode of operation now. Any other environments like CGI, FastCGI,
   etc. are now supported through corresponding CPAN:Plack::Handler adapters.
   $ OO-redesigned test framework : It's all said.
   $ PSGI testing framework : It comes as an extension to the legacy testing
   code and wraps around CPAN:Plack::Test.
   $ Manageable callbacks : Flexible and powerful, the new callback protocol
   unifies the interface and provides more control.
   $ Extensions : They're here to replace some day the old plugins framework.
   Their power is probably limitless within Perl's limitations. Yet many tasks
   are now easier to accomplish.
   $ Perl-based Config specs : The legacy specs bundled with special language
   are now just an additional data type of the new powerful specs format. There
   is no more need to learn a new obscure language to declare your configuration
   keys!
   $ Structured exceptions : Together with switching to CPAN:Try::Tiny and
   CPAN:Throwable exceptions are now forming an inheritance tree allowing
   better granularity of error processing.
   $ Macros as objects : A macro could now be defined as a class.
   $ Feature sets : Foswiki core and any component can now define a set of
   supported features as well as version range which defines a feature's life
   span. Any component (extensions mostly) can now request what features it
   needs to work correctly. This provides way more flexible control over
   code compatibility matters than just version range tests.

There are some under the hood changes in behaviour of some components like
=%PERLDOC{"Foswiki::Request"}%= initialization procedures; or alike.

---++ Basic Concepts

   $ [[OOCodeConcepts]] : Main concepts of programming under %WIKITOOLNAME% v3.
   $ [[EngineRevisedV3]] : Engine new role in Foswiki V3.
   $ [[ChainedExecutionFlow]] : Callbacks and extensions chaining of calls.
   $ [[CallbacksFramework]] : Callbacks framework

---++ New Standards And Major Changes

   $ [[SpecFileFormat]] : Config Specs v2
   $ [[MacrosAsOO]] : Object oriented macros model
   $ [[FoswikiV3Env]] : New environment variables

---+++ Configuration Management

All configuration-related functionality has been put into
%PERLDOC{"Foswiki::Config"}% class which is instantiated in
=%PERLDOC{"Foswiki::App" attr="cfg"}%= attribute. The functionality includes:

   * Bootstraping
   * Reading Local Site Configuration (LSC)
   * Fetching and handling of configuration specs (see Config Specs v2 above)

---+++ Easy File Handling

New class =%PERLDOC{"Foswiki::File"}%= provides simple and easy to use interface
for fetching/writing files.

---++ Testing

   $ [[FoswikiV3Testing]] : Code testing
