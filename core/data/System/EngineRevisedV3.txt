---+ Engine role in Foswiki v3

Introduction of application object concept led to another change in the core
concepts of Foswiki: engine's role has been revised and cleaned from nonrelevant
functionality. Now an engine is an abstraction layer between a web server
environment and Foswiki core. In other words, it's a driver. It is responsible
for providing the core with necessary data in a unified form, as documented in
=%PERLDOC{Foswiki::Engine}%=; and it is also provides the results of Foswiki
core work back to the web server.

From application/core object relations point of view an engine stays somewhat
aside from other objects as it is usually undesirable to create a new engine
object via direct call to =create()= method; static method
=%PERLDOC{"Foswiki::Engine" method="start"}%= must be used instead. It returns
a (hopefully) valid engine object which type corresponds to the working
environment.

%X% *NOTE:* Assuming that we currently rely upon
=[[CPAN:Plack::Handler][Plack::Handler]]= the most probable engine to be used
would be =%PERLDOC{Foswiki::Engine::PSGI}%=.

An engine object communicates with the rest of the code by providing a set of
attributes with predefined data formats where information obtained from the web
server can be found by clients (and =%PERLDOC{Foswiki::Request}%= is the most
important of them). Back from the core it expects data in PSGI format which is
now the standard.
